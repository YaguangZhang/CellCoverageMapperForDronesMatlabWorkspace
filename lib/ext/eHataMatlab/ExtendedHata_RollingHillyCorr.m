% Description: Function to compute "median" and "fine" rolling hilly
% terrain corrections for extended Hata propagation model. They are applied
% in the vicinity of the mobile station only). According to [2], this may
% apply to a mountainous area where there are several mountains which
% affect the receiving point by multiple diffraction, but not to a simple
% sloped terrain or where there is only one undulation.
% 
% Inputs: 
% - elev    : array containing elevation profile between Tx & Rx
%             where:
%             elev(1) = numPoints - 1 
%             (note, numPoints is the number of points between Tx & Rx)
%             elev(2) = distance between points (in meters). 
%             (thus, elev(1)-1)*elev(2)=distance between Tx & Rx)
%             elev(3) = Tx elevation (in meters)
%             elev(numPoints+2) = Rx elevation (in meters)
%
% Outputs: 
% - Krh     : total (both "median" and "fine") correction factor  for  
%             rolling hilly terrain (in decibels)
% - Kh      : "median" correction factor for rolling hilly terrain 
%             (in decibels)
% - Khf     : "fine" correction factor for rolling hilly terrain 
%             (in decibels)
