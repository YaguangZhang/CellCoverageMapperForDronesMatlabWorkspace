% Description: function to compute the extended Hata propagation loss. 
% The extended Hata propgation model was developed in [1] with the 
% following steps;
% - Revisit the Okumura et al. basic median attenuation curves [2],
% - Extend Hata's empirical formulae in both distance & frequency range[3],
% - Apply the "Urban Factor" approach suggested by Longley [4],
% - Implement site-specific corrections to the median attenuation
% including effective height corrections, median and fine corrections for
% rolling hilly terrain, general slope of terrain correction, isolated
% mountain, and mixed land-sea path correction [1,2].
%
% Inputs: 
% - freq_MHz    : frequency (in MHz), in the range of [1500, 3000] MHz
% - hb_ant_m    : antenna height (in meter) of the base station, 
%                 in the range of [30, 200] m. 
%                 Note, base station and Tx will be used interchangeably.
% - hm_ant_m    : antenna height (in meter) of the mobile station, 
%                 in the range of [1, 10] m.
%                 Note, mobile station and Rx will be used interchangeably.
% - region      : region of the area ('DenseUrban', 'Urban', 'Suburban')
% - elev        : an array containing elevation profile between Tx & Rx,
%                 where:
%                 elev(1) = numPoints - 1 
%                 (note, numPoints is the number of points between Tx & Rx)
%                 elev(2) = distance between points (in meters). 
%                 (thus, elev(1)-1)*elev(2)=distance between Tx & Rx)
%                 elev(3) = Tx elevation (in meters)
%                 elev(numPoints+2) = Rx elevation (in meters)
%
% Outputs:
% - LossEH      : total propagation loss (in dB)
