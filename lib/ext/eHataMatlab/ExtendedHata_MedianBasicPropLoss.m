% Description: Function to compute the extended Hata median basic
% transmission loss.
%
% Inputs: 
% - f   : frequency (in MHz), 
%         in the range of [1500, 3000] MHz
% - d   : distance (in km) between transmitter and receiver, 
%         in the range of [1, 100] km
% - hb  : antenna height (in meter) of the base station, 
%         in the range of [30, 200] m     
% - hm  : antenna height (in meter) of the mobile station, 
%         in the range of [1, 10] m     
% - region: region of the area ('DenseUrban', 'Urban', 'Suburban')
%
% Outputs: 
% - MedianLossEH  : median basic transmission loss (in dB)
% - MedianAbmEH   : basic median attenuation relative to free space (in dB)
%
% Note: the variable names are similar to thoese the NTIA Report [1]
