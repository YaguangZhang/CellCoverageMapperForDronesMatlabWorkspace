% Description: Function to compute terminals' "effective height" 
% corrections (for both base station and mobile) (see [1,2]).
% The terminals’ “effective height” corrections are defined as the 
% difference between the height of the terminal above mean sea level 
% (the sum of the terminal’s structural height above ground and the height 
% of the terrain below the terminal above mean sea level) and the average 
% height of terrain above mean sea level from 3 to 15 km distance from the
% terminal in question. These quantities are to be used in the height gain 
% terms in the extended Hata formulas. For paths less than 3 km, the 
% terminal’s structural height is used. For path distances between 3 and 
% 15 km length, the average ground height is weighted by fraction of the 
% path distance relative to 15 km.
% Note that if the effective height is negative, it will be set equal to 
% the average height of terrain above mean sea level.
%
% Inputs:
% - hb_ant_m    : antenna height (in meters) of the base station. 
% - hm_ant_m    : antenna height (in meters) of the mobile station. 
% - elev        : array containing elevation profile between Tx & Rx.
%
% Outputs:
% - hb_eff_m    : effective transmitting antenna height (in meters) of the 
%                base station. 
% - hm_eff_m    : effective receiving antenna height (in meters) of the 
%                mobile station.
