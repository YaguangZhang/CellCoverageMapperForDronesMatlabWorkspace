% Description: Function to compute the isolated ridge correction factor 
% of the extended Hata propagation model.    
%
% Inputs: 
% - elev    : array containing elevation profile between Tx & Rx
%             where:
%             elev(1) = numPointss - 1 
%             (note, numPointss is the number of points between Tx & Rx)
%             elev(2) = distance between points (in meters). 
%             (thus, elev(1)-1)*elev(2)=distance between Tx & Rx)
%             elev(3) = Tx elevation (in meters)
%             elev(numPointss+2) = Rx elevation (in meters)
% Outputs:
% - Kir     : correction factor for isolated ridge (in decibels)
